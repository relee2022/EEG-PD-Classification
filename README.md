# EEG-PD-Classification
Artificial intelligence systems that support rapid, relia-ble decision-making under real-time constraints require architectures capable of interpreting high-dimensional sensory inputs while maintaining robustness, generali-zability, and transparency. Electroencephalography (EEG), a dense and noisy biosignal, represents one of the most challenging real-time sensing modalities. Yet it is central to emerging applications in clinical decision-support, adaptive human–machine teaming, and neuro-physiological monitoring. This study presents a Trans-former-based deep learning framework for multi-class classification of Parkinson’s Disease (PD) from resting-state EEG, framing EEG-based diagnosis as a time-sensitive autonomous sensing and decision-making problem rather than a static offline analysis task. Using three BIDS-formatted OpenNeuro datasets encompassing heterogeneous recording conditions (PD1: n = 31, PD2: n = 50, PD3: n = 56), we evaluate how attention-based ar-chitectures across both resting-state and task-based EEG paradigms. A subject-wise cross-validation strategy was employed to prevent data leakage and to better approxi-mate real-world clinical deployment scenarios. Across all datasets, the Transformer model significantly outper-formed classical methods including Random Forest, Lo-gistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, and Deci-sion Trees. These methods achieved an F1-score up to 99.33% and AUC up to 99.99%. Attention maps high-light the model’s ability to dynamically allocate compu-tational focus to informative temporal and spectral EEG segments, demonstrating a form of adaptive resource al-location analogous to tactical AI decision pipelines. By advancing EEG classification toward interpretable, high-accuracy, and real-time-capable AI systems, this work il-lustrates the potential of Transformer architectures to support interdisciplinary applications in clinical diag-nostics, human–autonomy interaction, and real-time neu-rophysiological monitoring. More broadly, it shows how attention-based models can serve as a foundation for au-tonomous decision systems that operate under strict temporal and sensory constraints.
