# EEG-PD-Classification
Transformer-based framework for multi-class Parkinson’s disease classification from resting-state EEG reframes diagnosis as a time-sensitive autonomous decision task. Using three BIDS OpenNeuro datasets (PD1 n=31, PD2 n=50, PD3 n=56) with subject-wise CV, it outperformed RF, LR, SVM, and DT, achieving F1 99.33% and AUC 99.99%.
